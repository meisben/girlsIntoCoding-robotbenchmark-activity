title: Simulating Robots! 
---

A project activity for [Girls Into Coding](https://www.girlsintocoding.com/) using a online version of the free open source [Webots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/) robot simulator.

This session is designed to be fun! The idea is that we can follow it together online, but that we can be free to move at our own pace.

Here are some links that might help us with this sesion! You don't need to click them now! But they might help us as we go along!

* Python cheatsheet

## What is a robot simulator?
---
A robot simulator is like a video game, with robots in it! It's a very realistic version of the world, with one or more virtual robots inside.

### Let's try it out!!

We're going to be using [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) in this activity, which is a online version of the 'Webots' simulator. 

Navigate there in your browser now !

Click on the start button for the [pick and place](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/pick_and_place/simulation.php) activity.

You will see a video in the top right hand corner of the screen, try click

## Why simulate robots?

Why would we want to simulate robots? .... Well because it's helpful for designing them.

<h2>Poll!</h2>
<b>Question</b> If you become a robot designer in the future, what kind of robots would you prefer to build?
