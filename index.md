title: Simulating Robots! 
---

A project activity for [Girls Into Coding](https://www.girlsintocoding.com/) using a online version of the free open source [Webots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/) robot simulator.

This session is designed to be fun! The idea is that we can follow it together online, but that we can be free to move at our own pace.

* Python cheatsheet
* Webots documentation

## What is a robot simulator?
---
A robot simulator is like a video game, with robots in it! It's a very realistic version of the world, with one or more virtual robots inside.

### Let's try it out!!

We're going to be using [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) in this activity, which is a online version of the 'Webots' simulator. 

Navigate there in your browser now !

Click on the start button for the [pick and place](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/pick_and_place/simulation.php) activity.

You will see a video in the top right hand corner of the screen, try click

## Why simulate robots?
---

Why would we want to simulate robots? .... Well because it's helpful for designing them.

Let's take a look at this video.

[![Quad copter video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4he7mPV41Xc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4he7mPV41Xc?t=229)

In the video you can see a quadcopter designer trying out their software on a virtual robot. If it doesn't work, and the robot crashes it doesn't break the quadcopter! They can just change the software and restart the simulation until they get it right! Then they can try it on the real robot.

<h2>Poll!</h2>
<b>Question</b> If you become a robot designer in the future, what kind of robots would you prefer to build? How do you think simulation might be useful for this type of robot?
