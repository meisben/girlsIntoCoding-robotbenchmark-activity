## Overview

This code library provides functionality to control the EEZYbotARM (Mk1, Mk2) in 3-D space. Specifically its functionality includes: 

1. 3-D Forward kinematics
2. 3-D Inverse kinematics
3. Plotting of the (simulated) robot arm
4. Plotting of the (simulated) workspace of the robot arm
5. Communicating with a (arduino) microcontroller
6. Using the (arduino) microcontroller to control the movement of the robot arm servo motors
